// INSTRUCTIONS
// Function 1 - hello world

// Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

// Style Points
// Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the
// most creative hello world you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?

// For example:

// Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
// Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345
// You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.

// SOLUTION
// be careful about names of variable, function, etc!

// simple arrow function would work for this problem

// Write a function "greet" that returns "hello world!"
let greet = () => "hello world!";
